# Pics 'n' Words
Python project that takes a 1920 x 1080 image and a .txt file as inputs, and outputs the same image made out of colored text.
The program creates a transparent image of the same dimensions as the image with the text from the file on layered on top of it.
Each character from the text file is colored the same as that area of the original image.
The text is formatted as a rectangle with edge dimension ratio of 16:9, with spaces appended to make the number of characters in the text file a multiple of 144.
